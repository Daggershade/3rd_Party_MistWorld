# 3rd_Party_MistWorld
This includes any work I've done to improve a player's experience of the audio game MistWorld.
The bulk of this will be my English translation pack, kept up to date with my personal copy. Meaning this will be more up to date than the version posted to the Discord server, or the download page of the game's website.
Also included is an alternate keybind file for players who don't have access to the page up/down, home, and end keys, but do have a number-pad.
